# Carla Dataset Tools (Active Collecting Integrated)

Data collection tools with active data acquisition strategy implemented for CARLA Simulator.

## Installation

Download Carla version 0.9.14 [here](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla).

### Environment

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Write following env into your bashrc or zshrc
export CARLA_ROOT=[PATH_TO_YOUR_CARLA]
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla/dist/[YOUR_CARLA_EGG_NAME]:$CARLA_ROOT/PythonAPI/carla/
```

## Usage

### Data Recording

Execute the command in the root directory:

```shell
python3 data_recorder.py
```

### Dataset Preparing

#### Image, lidar dataset

We support image data as **YOLO** format, lidar data as **OpenPCDet** format.

Execute the command in the root directory:

```shell
python format_helper.py -s {raw_data/record...}
```

#### Lidar Data Visualization

Execute the command in the root directory to visualize lidar cloud point:

```shell
python label_tools/kitti_lidar/lidar_label_view.py -d {local_semantic_lidar.npy}
```

## Data

Data can be collected by just executing `python3 data_recorder.py`. The configuration can be changed by modifying the files in the folder `config`.

| Dataset Name | Total Frames | Map    |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------ |
| D1           | 900          | Town02 |
| D1-S         | 579          | Town02 |
| D2           | 900          | Town02 |
| V            | 375          | Town03 |

## Result

| Dataset Name | Vehicle | Training Time | mAP   |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------- | ----- |
| D1           | 996     | 14min40s      | 0.508 |
| D1-S         | 996     | 11min32s      | 0.492 |
| D2           | 1835    | 16min07s      | 0.647 |

## Future Work

To validate the correctness of the strategy, we'd better try multiple algorithms:

- [x] YOLO
- [ ] CenterPoint
